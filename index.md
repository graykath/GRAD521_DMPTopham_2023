# Data Description

research goals:
	Evaluate advanced breeding selections, historical cultivars, and wild Vaccinium species for virus symptoms and for presence of blueberry shock virus and luteovirus.
	Evaluate historical cultivars and wild vaccinium species for signs of tolerance or resistance to shock for further investigation.
	Investigate symptomatic plant genotypes that tested negative for blueberry shock virus, luteovirus, or both and subject those to high throughput sequencing (HTS). 
	Analyze HTS data for new shock and luteovirus isolates (genomic variants) as well as for other viruses including new and emerging viruses. 


Types of data:
1.	Physical samples: Approximately 2,000 blueberry leaf tissue samples from Pacific Northwest advanced breeding selections, historical cultivars, and wild Vaccinium species per collection year are to be collected over an anticipated 2-3 year study. A subsample from each sample will be lyophilized and stored at -20 C in preparation of laboratory analysis with the bulk of the sample stored at -80 C. An inventory of the samples collected will be maintained via a template created on a spreadsheet software. (less than 1 MB)
2.	Field observations: There will be hard-copy data sheets containing observations made in the field mapping the sample plots, matching samples to their individual ids, and indicated any viral symptoms observed. These will be subsequently transcribed for use in compiling datasets. The data denoting the specific growers collected from will need to be protected and not disclosed. (less than 1 MB)
3.	Laboratory data: These consist of hard-copy procedural documentation and digital files that contain information recorded during lab processing. This includes nucleic extraction parameters, RT-PCR parameters and results in the form of electrophoresis imaging, and Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) processing. Transcribed and instrument outputs are kept in raw form and referenced for the creation of compiled data sets. (10 MB)
4.	Compiling datasets: The generated dataset is to merge sample descriptors, lab processing and output data, and computation of statistical trends across the entire dataset and subsets of interest to prepare it for analysis. (less than 1 MB)
5.	Computational data: The data generated in the lab as well as from existing databases (NCGI) and collaborators (high throughput sequencing results), will need to be processed via computational software in order to annotate open reading frames (ORFs), align the novel sequence to known viral sequences, and complete phylogenetic analysis on the aligned sequences. Additional statistical analysis will be performed on the viral testing results. (10 MB)
6.	Historical records: This includes data type 4 listed above. They exist in the in a digital excel spreadsheet. (less than 1 MB)  

# Roles and responsibilities

The proper management of data is essential in any research project, and it requires the collaboration and commitment of all members involved. In this regard, the Project PI and graduate student play a critical role in ensuring that data management practices are adhered to throughout the project's lifespan.
The Project PI and graduate student have the primary responsibility for data management in the research project, which involves monitoring and ensuring compliance with the data management plan. This responsibility encompasses managing successive versions of the data and migrating them to new formats, platforms, and storage media as required by good practice in the digital preservation community.
To achieve this goal, the PI is expected to provide guidance to the graduate student and oversee their work, checking to ensure that the data preservation tasks are adequately performed. On the other hand, the graduate student is responsible for daily quality assessment of data and maintenance of the instrumentation while the data is being collected, processed, and analyzed. The graduate student may also receive assistance from other members of the lab, such as undergraduate student assistants, in the collection and preparation of samples to complete the workload promptly.
It is worth noting that the graduate student will only grant access to non-sensitive data, such as the assigned sample IDs, to anyone who provides support. The PI will oversee the analysis and metadata generation to confirm that the work completed by the graduate student is performed appropriately.
To ensure data security and preservation, the generated data must be stored and protected on a USDA server that is regularly backed up. Non-sensitive data can be processed on the graduate student's personal computer and then regularly uploaded to the USDA server. However, sensitive data, such as the direct sources of the samples, should be accessed solely on the USDA server, stored in a folder that only members of the research team can access.
In the event that the graduate student leaves the project, the PI assumes responsibility for the project until a replacement is found to complete the work.
In summary, the Project PI and graduate student have the critical responsibility of ensuring that data management practices are adequately followed during the research project's lifecycle. This includes managing successive iterations of the data, migrating them to new formats, platforms, and storage media, overseeing the daily quality assessment of data, and ensuring proper data security and preservation. Collaborative efforts among all members of the research team are essential to achieve these goals.
